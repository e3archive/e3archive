<h3 id="managing">Managing Archive</h3>
<ul>
    <li> First of all access the source code from <a href="https://githib.com/jeearchives/jeearchive"><mark>here</mark></a></li>
    <li>Just in case, The archive goes down or stays inactive for long time. You can host the website on your own.</li>
    <li><mark>I expect the person managing this archive has a basic knowledge of HTML.</mark></li>
    <li>Let me tell you how to add a new entry in the archive. Let the name of entry be- <code>xyz material</code>.</li>
    <li>First of all, upload the file on Tor using <a href="https://onionshare.org/"><mark>OnionShare</mark></a>.</li>
    <li>After uploading it there, you will get a link ending with <mark>.onion</mark>and a <mark>Private Key</mark>. You 
    will need these two things to allow people to download the files.</li>
    <li>Now go to the <code>files</code>FOLDER and make a new file there named <code>xyzmaterial.html</code>.</li>
    <li>Edit the <code>xyzmaterial.html</code>by taking source code from other .html files in the <code>files</code>folder.</li>
    <li>Make sure to add the .onion link and the Private Key.</li>
    <li>Now go to <code>files.html</code>and make a new entry there. I already mentioned that the user should know
        basics of html if he/she is managing the archive. I won't teach you <mark>HOW TO</mark> write html code. I expect you to know that.</li>
    <li>Now go to <code>updates.html</code>and make a new entry there.</li>
    <li>Now go to <code>search.html</code>and make a new entry there and don't forget to <code>href</code>it to 
    <code>files/xyzmaterial.html</code>.</li>
    
</ul>
<br>
  <h3 id="tornetwork">Why Tor Network ?</h3>
  <p>This website is <mark>NOT</mark> the kind of website which you find on Internet, When you search for <code>
    pdf's</code>of various books or coaching modules.</p>
    <p> It's an archive, It's purpose is to conserve the history of this exam. The materials used for 
        preparing for this exam in different eras whether it's the 90's or after 2007(major change in the pattern).
        This archive contains almost all the JEE Previous Year Papers, Modules of iconic Kota Coaching Industry,
        Test papers of all difficulties, Famous books of all the eras (relevant to JEE), etc. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        Ok, Now let's come to the point. I hosted this archive on Tor for two reasons 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To prevent copyright infrigment and to prevent it from getting copyrighted.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the download process of files much difficult, I do not want this website to get potrayed
            as a hub for downloading copyrighted materials. I do not want this website to look illegal because
            my intentions are to make this an archive website, not like various telegram channels where you 
            find various JEE material. Their intentions are not noble and what they are doing is illegal. Opposite
            of that, My intentions are good and I want to setup an archive, where anyone from any era can see
            the beautiful history of this exam, Enjoy the nostalgia by viewing the same book which they studied many
            years ago for preparing for this exam. Looking at the same module which they used in Kota, back in 
            there days. Hope you understand that.

        <ul>
            <li>
                I am not that good at writing a <code>Documentation</code>. It's my first time to be honest.
                Please ignore the mistakes I made.
