    <h3>My Request !</h3>
    <p>
      I DO NOT OWN ANY MATERIAL HOSTED IN JEE ARCHIVE. AGAR KOI COACHING MEIN KAAM KARNE VALA ISKO PADH RAHA HAI TO MAAF KARDO SIR/MAM, GALTI HO GAYI. IF SOMEONE IS FROM SOUTH AND ONLY UNDERSTANDS ENGLISH, I AM VERY SORRY FOR HOSTING THIS MATERIAL, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE LEGAL ACTIONS AGAINST ME. THIS PROJECT IS INSPIRED FROM archive.org (Internet Archive). THE <mark>INTERNET ARCHIVE</mark> ALSO CONTAINS MANY COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL BUT THERE INTENTION IS TO PRESERVE IT, AND SO IS MINE. THAT IS WHY I HAVE MADE THE DOWNLOAD PROCESS OF FILES MUCH DIFFICULT. IT JUST SERVES AS AN ARCHIVE, NOT AS A GENERAL PURPOSE WEBSITE WHICH YOU COMMONLY FIND ON INTERNET FOR DOWNLOADING JEE MATERIAL. I HAVE NO MALICIOUS INTENTIONS.
